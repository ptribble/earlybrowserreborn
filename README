This is a copy of the earlybrowserreborn repo

The aim is to get these early browsers running on a modern system,
specifically the illumos distribution Tribblix

The result are unlikely to be generally useful, as these old browsers
lack decent protocol support and will be unable to cope with most
modern content. However, it should be possiblt to create simple sites
to give you a feel for what the web was like in the beginning.
