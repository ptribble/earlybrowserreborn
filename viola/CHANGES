Initial set of changes to get a successful build on illumos

Use gcc by default - both in the xmkmf invocations and in the Imakefiles

Pass -fcommon, needed by gcc10

We're solaris, not sunos, so use sun4-sol2

Don't assume . is in the PATH.

In viola/utils.h, remove unnecessary (and wrong) definitions of bcopy and bzero

Fix includes in libWWW/Library/Implementation/tcp.h so we use dirent

Fix random() in viola/cl_generic.c, and #include <unistd.h> and <sys/fcntl.h>
so we can find R_OK

In viola/viola.c, just say no to sys_errlist

Remove BUILD.decstation
