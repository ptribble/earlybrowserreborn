Initial set of changes to get a successful build on illumos
(it builds, but doesn't work)

Add a BUILD wrapper

In CommonMakefile, use uil rather than the undefined $(UIL), and
the objects need midas.uid built first.

Remove the binary uid2c, it was for Linux and the build will regenarate
a new one correctly.

Make ad2c executable.

midaswww.c needs to #include <sys/filio.h> for FIONBIO

No sys_errlist, atexit, or redefinition of strerror() in midasnet.h

Use strerror() rather than sys_errlist in SGMLHyper.c
